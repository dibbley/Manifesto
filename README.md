Packetbroker.org is an independent and neutral organisation running a broker for Internet of Things packets. Open IoT allows messages from devices that are connected to certain networks to arrive a different network. Packetbroker.org provides a platform for IoT operators to exchange this data for greater network efficiency.

The following principles apply. Packetbroker.org is:

* Independent and not for profit - the sole purpose is to facilitate the exchange of encrypted IoT data. The organisation is not for profit and the overhead costs are covered by a membership fee of 25,000 dollars a year.
* IoT technology agnostic - Independent of RF technology the broker is able to route data. E.g. LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, BLE, Zigbee
* Democratic governance - Members are able to vote on the direction of the organisation and design of the packet broker
* Not a marketplace - the focus is on the exchange of data, business models, roaming or paid peering agreements are out of scope for the organisation. Reporting data is provided to build bilateral business agreements for the exhange of data.
